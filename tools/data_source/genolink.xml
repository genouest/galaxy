**What it does**

GenoLink imports a file from the Genouest cluster (/home, /omaha-beach, /groups, /scratch) into the current history. There is no copy, so the upload time is very short. Your uploaded file is neither deleted nor altered in your Home.

This tool is only working with one input file. The tool crashes if a directory is found.

Your file must be readable for others.

If you move or remove the original file from the cluster, it will not be usable in Galaxy anymore.
